## What is a TIP?

TIPs were created to provide an open source technical specification standard to share resources with the Ternoa's community. The TIPs are suggested references to the Ternoa ecosystem and more generally to Substrate, the Polkadot framework. TIPs are intended to evolve continuously in order to meet the standards of the expanding market.

## Mission

The goal of the TSP project is to document standardized protocols for Ternoa clients and applications and to document them in a high quality and implementable way.
