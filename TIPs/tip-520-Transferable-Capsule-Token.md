# Transferable Capsule Token (TCT)

## Simple Summary

Ternoa has created the "Transferable Capsule Token" which is a new kind of token that allow users to store unlimited confidential data transferable on time.

## Abstract

Think of capsule as enhanced form of NFT which can take any number of files in encrypted media. Issuer should be able to convert his NFT into TCT and to be able to add limitless datas. 

## Motivation

Existing storage solutions are limited and does not provide automated transfers services.

- Centralized storage solutions mean we have to be confident on the company that manage storage in term of security, maintenance and ethic.
- Data Privacy is something foundamental for humanity. Only decentralized solutions can provide real data privacy allowing users to get ownership of their own datas.
- Data transmission is something we all think about but no secured and automated services exist.

For all those points, Ternoa created TCT to bring a powerful solution to solve data issues.
