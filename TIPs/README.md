# Ternoa Improvement Proposals (TIPs)

## What is a TIP?

TIP stands for Ternoa Improvement Proposal. A TIP is a design document providing information to the Ternoa community, or describing a new feature for Ternoa or its processes or environment. The TIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The TIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

## Mission

The goal of the TSP project is to document standardized protocols for Ternoa clients and applications and to document them in a high quality and implementable way.
