# Ternoa Proposals (TSPs & TIPs)

## What is a TSP?

TSP is a standard document that provide technical specifications and detailled explanations of an implemented feature on Ternoa.

## What is a TIP?

TIPs were created to provide an open source technical specification standard to share resources with the Ternoa's community. The TIPs are suggested references to the Ternoa ecosystem and more generally to Substrate, the Polkadot framework. TIPs are intended to evolve continuously in order to meet the standards of the expanding market.

## Mission

The goal of the Ternoa Proposals project is to document standardized protocols for Ternoa clients and applications and to document them in a high quality and implementable way.

## How to suggest a proposal?

To suggest a proposal, you can create a Pull Request with your new proposal as a TIP or TSP following our template. Each new proposal will be review by the PC (Product Council) of Ternoa. After reviewing, some feedbacks will be share or directly validated by the PC.
